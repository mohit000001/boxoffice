This is a website for a film production company. it is a home project developed in core PHP just for my learning purpose.
I developed this project in 2017, at that time I was a beginner to build a semi-large project and I was learning PHP and MYSQL development.
So I started this project to understand PHP and a semi-large project development that deals with databases.
Now in 2022, I'm pushing this project in GitHub to show my previous learning items. It is not a very professionally designed project so please ignore the spelling and sentence mistakes in its content. Also, the project was built in 2017, and it is not comfortable with the latest PHP and MySQL versions to solve this issue I have dockerized this app using docker so that anyone can run this project with less effort than setting up the ENV items. All other details are as follows.
